A cybersecurity mini-project to scrape `.onion` sites over the Tor network, analyze page content for sensitive keywords (e.g., credentials, leaks), and store alerts in a SQLite database. Includes a Streamlit dashboard for interactive use.

# Features

- 🔍 Custom user input for .onion URLs
- 🕸️ Multi-page crawling across internal links
- ⚠️ Keyword-based threat detection (leaks, credentials, confidential terms)
- 💾 SQLite database for structured alert storage
- 📊 Streamlit dashboard to run analysis and view alerts
- 🛠️ Easily extendable for enrichment (e.g., scoring, integration with SIEM)

  
# Setup

1. Install Tor and run the daemon:
   ```
   sudo apt install tor
   sudo service tor start
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the dashboard:
   ```
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

**Note**: For ethical, legal use only. Avoid scraping login-protected or illicit content.

A cybersecurity-focused project that scrapes `.onion` dark web sites through the Tor network, scans for sensitive keywords (e.g., leaks, credentials, confidential data), and logs threat intelligence alerts in a local SQLite database — all accessible through a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard.

This project is designed as a **practical mini-NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System)** component for use in **SOC operations, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence, and Audit & Compliance** research.

🚨 Built for educational and ethical research purposes only.


## 💡 Why This Project Matters

This minor project bridges the gap between **academic learning** and **real-world SOC work**. It simulates dark web threat monitoring pipelines often used by cybersecurity analysts for:

- 🔎 Early detection of leaked credentials and corporate data
- 📚 Building experience with **Tor scraping**, **threat hunting**, and **data logging**
- 🧪 Exploring detection engineering ideas in a safe, simulated environment
- 🛡️ Understanding compliance risks related to dark web disclosures
